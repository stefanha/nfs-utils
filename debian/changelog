nfs-utils (1:1.0.2-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream version:
    > Allow program stdin to be a non-INET socket.  (closes: #142557)
  * Start nfs-common after nfs-kernel-server so that the server is running
    when statd restarts; without this change, a rebooting server may make
    clients lose mounts.  (This postinst removes bad rc.d links from old
    packages.)  From Philippe Troin <phil@fifi.org>.  (closes: #160800)
  * Make init scripts exit with non-zero status when daemons don't start.
  * Add titles to templates where I forgot them.  (closes: #158489)
  * Add /etc/default/{nfs-common,nfs-kernel-server} so setting random

    (closes: #134630)
  * Use invoke-rc.d to avoid premature daemon starts.  (closes: 158574)

nfs-utils (1:1.0.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version:
    > BIG CHANGE: Exports default to "sync", that is, synchronous writes.
      This is safer but MUCH SLOWER than the old default of "async".
      All exports should be marked as either "sync" or "async" to avoid a
      warning from exportfs.
  * Patches from CVS through 2002-08-26.
  * Let init script start statd on a specific port.  (closes: #144344)
  * Fix typo in debconf message about tcpwrappers.  (closes: #128709)

nfs-utils (1:0.3.3-6) unstable; urgency=high

  * Upstream fixes:
    > Ignore case when comparing host names.
    > Use all addresses of multi-homed hosts in export processing.
    > When reading /proc/fs/nfs/exports, assume noasync and nowgather;
      older kernels did so, while newer kernels report them explicitly.
    > Remove man page refs to "hosts_allow(5)".  (closes: #122540)
    > In exports.5: Emphasize the need for options to immediately follow
      client names.  Explain that wildcards don't usually work on addresses,
      but may work when reverse DNS fails. (closes: #118040, #116039)

  * Upstream fixes:

      after upgrade.  (closes: #78801)
    > Put filenames into more error messages.
  * Stop debconf before starting nfsd to avoid a hang.  Kernel threads
    like nfsd aren't supposed to inherit open files from the programs that
    start them, but nfsd does.  See debconf tutorial.  (closes: #115817)
  * Rebuild with current glibc.  (closes: #119545)
  * Carefully account for ownership of /var/lib/nfs/*.  (closes: #117258)
