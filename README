This is the Linux NFS utility package version 0.1.2. It is based on
knfsd 1.4.7.

WARNING: The NFS servers in Linux 2.2 to 2.2.12 are not compatible with
other NFS client implemenations. If you plan to use Linux 2.2.x as an
NFS server for non-Linux NFS clients, you should get the Linux NFS
kernel from the Linux NFS CVS server:

1. Set the environment variable, CVS_RSH, to ssh.
2. Login to the Linux NFS CVS server:

# cvs -z 3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.linuxnfs.sourceforge.org:/cvsroot/nfs login

without password if it is your first time.

3. Check out the current Linux 2.2 NFS kernel:

a. From the NFS V2 branch:

# cvs -z 3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.linuxnfs.sourceforge.org:/cvsroot/nfs co -r linux-2-2-nfsv2 linux-2.2

b. From the main trunk:

# cvs -z 3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.linuxnfs.sourceforge.org:/cvsroot/nfs co linux-2.2

4. If you don't want to use the current NFS kernel, you can find out
for which kernels the NFS patch is available:

# cd linux-2.2
# cvs -z 9 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.linuxnfs.sourceforge.org:/cvsroot/nfs status -v Makefile

Then generate the kernel patch:

# cvs -z 3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.linuxnfs.sourceforge.org:/cvsroot/nfs rdiff -ko -u -r linux-2-2-xx -r linux-2-2-xx-nfsv2-xxxxx linux-2.2

If there is no NFS patch for the kernel you are interested in, you have
to make a patch closest to your kernel version and apply it by hand.

There is a Linux NFS kernel source tree for Linux 2.3, linux-2.3, on
the Linux NFS CVS server. However, it is not maintained. We will need
all the help we can get. To contribute to the Linux NFS project, please
go to

http://www.linuxnfs.sourceforge.org

and login as "beta" with password "beta4u". You register yourself.
please send an email to nfs-admin@linuxnfs.sourceforge.org with

1. Your user id on www.linuxnfs.sourceforge.org.
2. The area in NFS you'd like to work on.

You will be notified when it is done.

There is a Linux NFS mailing list at

http://lists.varesearch.com/lists/listinfo/nfs/

You can subscribe it and search the mailing list archive via a web
browser.

The nfs-utils package is avaible from the CVS server:

# cvs -z 3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.linuxnfs.sourceforge.org:/cvsroot/nfs co nfs-utils

will get the latest version.

The files are

ftp://ftp.valinux.com/pub/support/hjl/nfs/nfs-utils-0.1.2.tar.gz
ftp://ftp.valinux.com/pub/support/hjl/nfs/nfs-utils-0.1.1-0.1.2.diff.gz

To compile, just do

# ./configure
# make

# make install

will install the nfs-utils binaries. You have to install the NFS
service scripts. There are 2 in etc/redhat provided for RedHat 6.x.
They are tested on RedHat 6.1.

On RedHat 6.1, you can use

# rpm -ta nfs-utils-0.1.2.tar.gz

to build the source and binary RPMs.

If your mount from util-linux is too old, you will need 2 patches:

ftp://ftp.valinux.com/pub/support/hjl/nfs/util-linux-2.9o-mount-nfsv3.patch
ftp://ftp.valinux.com/pub/support/hjl/nfs/util-linux-2.9w-mount-nfsv3try.patch

Thanks.
